# scss-default
A master file for setting up typography elements in Foundation 6 working with the _settings.scss defaults.

This file uses defaults set in Foundation's _settings.scss, and can be imported at the end of the app.scss for inclusion.

It is intended to be compiled using the Foundation CLI or Yeti Launch.

Extends using Modular Scale, added in bower_components: https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass - this can be removed by replacing @include ms-respond with simple css.
